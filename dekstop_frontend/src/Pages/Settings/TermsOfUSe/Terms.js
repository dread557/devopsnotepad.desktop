              <span className={classes.span}>
                Basic subscriber information:

              identifiers like your email address, and since there’s no

            <li>
              <span className={classes.span}>Usage data:</span> We collect and
              log Internet or other electronic network information on how you
              and others access and use it, for example, the act of creating a
              note or sharing a note. Usage data may be collected through
              cookies and similar technologies.
            </li>
            <li>

              to connect to the OpsPad Service, as well as information about the

              as your device’s unique hardware identifiers (IMEI, SIM number, or
